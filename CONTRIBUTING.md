# Contributing to PrivacyGo Data Clean Room

We happily welcome contributions to the PGDCR. We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/issues) to track community reported issues and [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/pulls) for accepting changes.


Read our [Code of Coduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide details how to use issues and pull requests to improve the project.

## General Guidelines

### Pull Requests

Make sure to keep Pull Requests small and functional to make them easier to review, understand, and look up in commit history. 

Adding the appropriate documentation, unit tests and e2e tests as part of a feature is the responsibility of the feature owner, whether it is done in the same Pull Request or not.

Pull Requests should follow the "Title: Description" format, where the Description describes what part of the code is being modified.

### Design Docs

A contributor proposes a design with a PR on the repository to allow for revisions and discussions. If a design needs to be discussed before formulating a document for it, make use of Google doc and [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/issues) to involve the community on the discussion.

### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are used to file bugs, work items, and feature requests with actionable items/issues (Please refer to the "Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests" section below for more information).

### Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features that have actionable items/issues (as opposed to introducing a feature request on GitHub Discussions).

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of the code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

### Find interesting issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue by clicking the [New issue](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/issues/new).


### Open a Pull request.

When you're done making the changes, open a [Pull Requests](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/pulls) and fill PR template so we can better review your PR. The [template](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PrivacyGo-DataCleanRoom/issues/new) helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.

If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [github tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.


## Finding contributions to work on

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, uses the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' and 'good first issue' issues are a great place to start.
